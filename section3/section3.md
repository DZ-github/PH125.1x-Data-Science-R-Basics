# Section 3 Overview

Section 3 introduces to the R commands and techniques that help you wrange, analyze and visualize data.

In Section 3.1, you will:

* Subset a vector based on properties of another vector. 
* Use multiple logical operators to index vectors.
* Extract the indices of vector elements satisfying one or more logical conditions. 
* Extract the indices of vector elements matching with another vector.
* Determine which elements in one vector are present in another vector. 

In Section 3.2, you will:

* Wrangle data tables using the functions in ‘dplyr’ package. 
* Modify a data table by adding or changing columns. 
* Subset rows in a data table.
* Subset columns in a data table. 
* Perform a series of operations using the pipe operator. 
* Create data frames. 

In Section 3.3, you will:
* Plot data in scatter plots, box plots and histograms. 

There are 3 assignments that use the DataCamp platform for you to practice your coding skills.

We encourage you to use R to interactively test out your answers and further your learning.
