# Section 4 Overview

Section 4 introduces you to general programming features like **if-else**, and **for loop** commands so that you can write your own functions to perform 
various operations on datasets.

In Section 4.1, you will:
* Understand some of the programming capabilities of R. 

In Section 4.2, you will:
* Use basic conditional expressions to perform different operations. 
* Check if any or all elements of a logical vector are TRUE. 

In Section 4.3, you will:
* Define and call functions to perform various operations.
* Pass arguments to functions, and return variables/objects from functions.

In Section 4.4, you will:
* Use ‘for’ loop to perform repeated operations. 
* Articulate in-built functions of R that you could try for yourself. 

There is one assignment that uses the DataCamp platform for you to practice your coding skills.

We encourage you to use R to interactively test out your answers and further your learning.
